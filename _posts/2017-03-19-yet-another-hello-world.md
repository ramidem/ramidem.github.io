title: "Yet Another Hello World!"
---

Hello, World! I am Med. A self-taught web developer from the Philippines.

I have finally decided to just do it. I have no clue how this is gonna go but I am going to keep trying. This is what I want to do. This is what satisfies me.

This website runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is being hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). Hopefully, I can write a post how I put its code all together. _Hint_: A lot of Googling and copying codes from other websites running on Jekyll as well.

> "Macro Patience, Microspeed"

As of this post, all the codes and the website itself is still a mess. But I will take my time, I have more to learn and a lot more mistakes to make.

I will make this website a playground to learn to **Write**, **Code**, and **Design**.

This website is [Opensource](https://github.com/ramidem/ramidem.github.io) and I welcome any suggestions. For anything else, tweet to me [@ramidem](https://twitter.com/ramidem) or shoot me an [email](mailto:im.ramidem@gmail.com).
