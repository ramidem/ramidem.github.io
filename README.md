# Hello, World!

Welcome to the sourcecode of my Internet home.

So, one day, I just decided to put up this blog and keep working on it until I become satisfied - I am sure I won't be.

If I have to wait for that perfect time to come up with the perfect blog/website, nothing will really happen. With this simple website I could finally get started and confidently call myself a Web Developer.


Cheers,

Med
