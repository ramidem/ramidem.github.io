  <p>The idea is to just ship thip website so I would no longer have any reason to just sit around and get distracted from learning Web Development.</p>
  <p>I intend to use this website as a reminder to always keep on learning. Right now, I just need to put it online. Also, I want to write. And the only way to learn it is to <strong>Write</strong>.</p>
  <p>This website is Opensource. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ramidem/ramidem.github.io">contribute or edit</a> however you want.</p>
  <p>BTW, I am still writing the proper "<em>About Me</em>".</p>
